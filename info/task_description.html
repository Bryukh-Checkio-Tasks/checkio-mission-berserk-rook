    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> is one of the ancient games and
    Almost everyone has at least a basic understanding of its rules.
    Let's we look at rooks - dangerous shock figure which can be used for a swift thrust or for a dense defence.
</p>

<p>
    Chess is a two-player strategy game played on a checkered game board laid out in eight rows
    (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and
    eight columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares.
    Each square of the chessboard is identified by a unique coordinate pair
    â€” a letter and a number (ex, "a1", "h8", "d6").
    For this mission we only need to concern ourselves with rooks.
</p>
<p>
    The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares,
    but may not leap over other pieces.
    As with captures by other pieces, the rook captures by occupying the square on which the enemy piece sits.
</p>
<p>
    For this mission you have one berserk rook against army of enemy rooks.
    Berserk rook can move again if it capture enemy figure.
    So it will be move and capture until you have targets. One "empty" step and it will stop.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a position of your berserk rook and positions of enemy rooks.
    Your goal is capture as many figures as possible without stop.
    So each move in your sequence should be effective and capture enemy figure.
    The result is what is the maximum enemy rooks can be captured.
